## Aznor's Working Experience 1
1. Data Scientist
Year: May 2022 to Jul 2023
Organisation: NCS Pte Ltd
Aznor's Achievements: 
a. Researched, designed and developed AI models for use-cases in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Document Understanding and Machine Learning for Proof-of-Concept studies to demonstrate the value of AI: 
- Cleaned and pre-processed tabular and text data using Pandas and Spacy; experimented with different machine learning algorithms using sklearn and Tensorflow; developed a CNN model trained on a small dataset (n < 200) that predicts labels with > 80% accuracy and highlights important words used for prediction. 
- Developed NLP approach to cluster similar documents based on semantic similarity using word embeddings and the overlap of words, enabling CRM system to quickly identify previously reported cases.  
- Built and deployed a prototype NLP API that carried out Abstractive Dialogue Summarisation based on state-of-the-art Transformer models using Hugging Face and PyTorch, allowing users of call center systems to quickly understand the context of cases. 
- Developed a working demo of an end-to-end OCR solution using PyTorch and AWS (i.e. Amazon Sagemaker, SageMaker Endpoints and Amazon S3) that automates the extraction of data from physical forms, potentially reducing cost for the customer. 
b. Built an automated machine learning functionality in Python for an AI platform that automatically cleans and pre-processes tabular data, conducts hyper-parameter tuning to find the best performing model and provides error analysis of the model for regression or classification tasks. 
c. Architected solution that modernizes the data engineering, data governance and analytics platform of a large public education institution by migrating legacy on-premise systems to Azure services such as Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure DevOps, Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage and Power BI.
- Reviewed existing on-premise systems of customers and evaluated different Azure and Microsoft solutions to improve data platform for use cases such as data governance.
- Planned and executed data migration of existing on-premises MSSQL Data Warehouse, MSSQL Data Marts and MySQL databases to Azure SQL Managed Instance, ensuring data integrity and validity of migrated data.
- Re-designed data sharing capabilities across on-premise and cloud systems by implementing SFTP workflow using Azure Data Factory and Azure Blob Storage.
- Built data engineering pipelines to move data from on-premise data sources and conduct transformations using T-SQL and Azure Data Factory.
- Reviewed and developed solution to automate internal data request and granting processes using tools such as Microsoft Forms, Power Automate and Microsoft Lists for: 1. end-users to review and request for data; 2. managers and data owners to review request; and 3. data administrators to grant access to data access request.

2. Data Engineer (Intern)
Year: Aug 2021 to Feb 2022
Organisation: 99 Group
Aznor's Achievements:
a. Enhanced in-house data engineering platform for developers to implement data engineering pipelines using containerisation of code with docker, Airflow and Google Kubernetes Engine, allowing developers to independently build ETL pipelines using tools that the developers are familiar with. 
b. Sourced and extracted new data from public APIs and the web using data crawlers built in Python that was used as the source of information for a new geolocation feature in a property search application. 
c. Worked with various teams to develop and deploy data engineering pipelines in production using Git, SQL, Python, Airflow and cloud services.
