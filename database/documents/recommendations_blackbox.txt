The following is Aznor's recommendation letter from a previous supervisor: 
Aznor worked for Blackbox Research Pte Ltd for two years, starting as a Research Analyst on February 2015 before leaving the company as a Senior Research Analyst in 2017. 
From the beginning Aznor joined my team and I have worked closely with him on many challenging projects, I was never disappointed with the outcomes. As an integral team member of the public policy research team Aznor contributed significantly to thc team's growth and success.
He has continuously improved his professional skillset and was able to demonstrate his ability to deal with clients independently while efficiently managing research projects with minimal guidance from his supervisors. Throughout Aznor's stint at Blackbox Research, he was proactive and demonstrated excellent work ethic to meet every aspect demanded from a project. Whenever possible he contributed his own ideas and took the initiative to ensure the successful outcome of each project.
While in Blackbox, he proved his ability by contributing to the major share of project management on 17 different ad-hoc research projects and 2 continuous tracking research studies for various clients across the commercial and public sectors:
- His responsibility included formulating research frameworks and questionnaire instruments; adopting suitable methodologies for research studies; supervising operations; analysing survey data; and presenting key findings to Blackbox's clients and ther management teams.
- Aznor developed a keen understanding of the several key clients, including very senior Government officials. He was confident in interacting with senior officials on questions ranging from research design to interpretation of the research results and its implications for the client.
- He demonstrated his passion and drive for new innovation when the company rolled cut a new data visualisation technology Sisense: and developed dashboards for clients and for Blackbox's own internal research teams.
- Aznor was also trained in focus group moderation while in Blackbox. He succesfully moderated 8 different focus group discussions and carried out dozens of in-depth interviews to obtain deeper insights on a wide range of social and community issues.
- As a Senior Research Analyst, he was an exemplary role model and also provided useful guidance, for interns and newly hired juniors, on all matters pertaining to project management.
I believe Aznor has great enthusiasm for his work and does not hesitate to take on new assignments. Based on my personal interactions with him, I am confident that he will add tremendous value to any future organisation to have the privilege to work with him.
I wholeheartedly recommend Aznor for future endeavours he chooses to take on and wish him a bright and fulfilling journey.
Sincerely,
Johannes Loh
Research Director
